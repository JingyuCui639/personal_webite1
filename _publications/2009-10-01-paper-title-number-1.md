**Abstract**

In the midst of the global outbreak with over 300,000 worldwide death cases of COVID-19, Canada has reported 79,101 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as of May 19, 2020, in which the severity differs from region to region. To provide a timely view and understanding of the evolving pandemic in Canada, we develop a real time interactive web-based platform which primarily includes data visualization and statistical analysis. The website highlights real time tracking of the development of COVID-19 with visualized graphs and forecasts future trends with applications of different statistical predictive models. By providing research-based statistical analysis, we are able to shed the light on the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. We also provide timely social news and preventive measures from the government on the website.
