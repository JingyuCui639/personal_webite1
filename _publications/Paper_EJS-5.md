**Abstract**

Handling variable selection in multivariate regression models becomes challenging when covariates are mixed with both continuous and categorical variables subject to mismeasurement, and the multiple response variables are subject to missingness. Existing methods often ignore these imperfections of data that are prevalent in applications. To address this gap, we develop a unified estimating equation framework, which enables simultaneous parameter estimation, variable selection, and accommodation of imperfect data, with misclassification in discrete covariates, measurement error in continuous covariates, and missingness in the multivariate responses. Incorporating auxiliary data sources, such as replicates or validation data, we integrate the estimation of nuisance parameters (related to the missingness and mismeasurement processes) into the estimation and variable selection process for the response model of the primary interest. Our development extends the usual variable selection framework that critically requires error-free data. We rigorously establish theoretical properties for the proposed methods and devise the implementation procedure for our methods. Extensive simulations demonstrate satisfactory finite sample performance of our methods. Applied to a household survey dataset, our methods identify key factors associated with mental and physical health conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. A sensitivity analysis highlights the impact of measurement error and missingness and the importance of properly addressing data imperfections.
