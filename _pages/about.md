I am currently a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Biostatistics at Yale School of Public Health, under the supervision of Dr. [Donna Speigelman](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/donna-spiegelman/). One of my current research interests is adaptive clinical trial design, and I am working on a novel adaptive framework known as the Learn-As-you-GO (LAGO), collaboratively with Dr. [Judith L. Lok](https://www.bu.edu/math/profile/judith-lok/) at Boston University.

I gained my Ph.D. in Statistics from Western University in London, Ontario, Canada, under the supervision of Dr. [Grace Y. Yi](https://fisher.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/yyi/), developing methods for high-dimensional imperfect data with measurement error and missing values. 

My research interests also extend to variable selection, mediation analysis, meta-analysis, clinical trials, and nonparametric methods. etc.
